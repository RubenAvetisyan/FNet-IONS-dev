####  This code is a TypeScript file that defines a class for managing MySQL database connections in a Node.js application. This class, named `Connection`, is part of a larger project called "FNet-Payment-System." The `Connection` class is located in the "utils/MySQL" directory, which suggests it is a utility class for the MySQL database connections.

####  Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Import statements: The code imports required packages and modules for establishing and managing a connection to a MySQL database. These include:
    
    
    - `mysql`: The MySQL client for Node.js.
    - `promisify`: A utility function from the 'util' module to convert a callback-based function into a Promise-based function.
    - `mysqlConfig`: A configuration object for connecting to the MySQL server.
2. Connection class: The `Connection` class is defined with the following methods:
    
    
    - `constructor`: Initializes an instance of the class by creating a MySQL connection pool using the imported `mysqlConfig`. A connection pool is a collection of connections to a database that can be reused, which helps to manage resources and improve performance.
    - `getConnection`: This async method retrieves a connection from the connection pool. It returns a Promise that resolves with a connection or rejects with an error.
    - `query`: This async method is a wrapper for executing SQL queries. It first gets a connection from the pool using the `getConnection` method, then promisifies the `query` function of the connection, so it can be used with async/await. Finally, it executes the SQL query and returns a Promise that resolves with the query results or rejects with an error. After executing the query, the connection is released back to the pool.

- `beginTransaction`: This async method starts a new transaction on a connection. It first gets a connection from the pool using the `getConnection` method, then promisifies the `beginTransaction` function of the connection, so it can be used with async/await. Finally, it starts the transaction and returns a Promise that resolves with the connection or rejects with an error.
- `commit`: This async method commits a transaction on a connection. It takes a connection as an argument, promisifies the `commit` function of the connection, and then commits the transaction. Finally, it returns a Promise that resolves with the result or rejects with an error. After committing the transaction, the connection is released back to the pool.
- `rollback`: This async method rolls back a transaction on a connection. It takes a connection as an argument, promisifies the `rollback` function of the connection, and then rolls back the transaction. Finally, it returns a Promise that resolves with the result or rejects with an error. After rolling back the transaction, the connection is released back to the pool.

3. Export statement: The `Connection` class is exported as a default export, which allows other modules to import and create instances of the class as needed.

Overall, this `Connection` class is a utility for managing MySQL connections in the FNet-Payment-System project. It provides an interface for executing queries, managing transactions, and working

with connection pools, which simplifies the process of interacting with the MySQL database. By using this class, developers can focus on implementing the application's logic without worrying about the low-level details of managing database connections and transactions.

When using this class in other parts of the FNet-Payment-System project, developers can import it and create a new instance of the `Connection` class. Then, they can use the provided methods to interact with the database, such as executing queries, starting transactions, committing or rolling back transactions, as needed.

### For example:

```

import Connection from './utils/MySQL/connection-class';

// Create an instance of the Connection class
const db = new Connection();

// Execute a query
const results = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users');

// Start a transaction, perform operations, and commit the transaction
const connection = await db.beginTransaction();
try {
  await db.query('UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1', connection);
  await db.query('UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2', connection);
  await db.commit(connection);
} catch (error) {
  await db.rollback(connection);
  console.error('Error during transaction, rolled back:', error);
}

```

This example demonstrates how to use the `Connection` class to perform common database operations such as executing queries and managing transactions in a simplified and efficient manner.
